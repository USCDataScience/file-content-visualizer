    <h4>Byte Frequency Analysis (BFA)</h4>

    <p>We've implemented BFA on each file type in the polar dataset. We computed the byte signatures
       for 75% of the files in each type. You can view the byte signature for a given type by clicking
       on the type in the bottom of the screen. You can select multiple types at a time. You can also zoom
       into smaller regions. There is a character chart (just below) to correlate by readings
       with text characters.</p>
