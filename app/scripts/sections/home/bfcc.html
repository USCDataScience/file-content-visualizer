    <h4>Byte Frequency Cross-Correlation (BFCC)</h4>

    <p>We've computed byte frequency cross-correlation on the BFA signatures computed for each type.
       Matrix values which are 0 are displayed in white. Values which are 1 are displayed in black.
       Values from 0 to 1 are displayed in varying shades of grey. Darker regions indicate closeness to 1.
       Clicking on the type will load the cross-correlation visualization for the given type.
       <b>Please note the visualization is slow to load</b>. It takes about 10 seconds to load once the type is clicked.
       Only one correlation matrix can be viewed at a time.</p>
