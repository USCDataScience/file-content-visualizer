    <h4>File Size Variation</h4>

    <p>We've analyzed the variations of file-size in the data set for each file type. We then
       clustered files using k-means clustering based on their file sizes into five clusters.
       We've computed the average BFA signature for each cluster to analyze the variation of
       signatures across type. We also computed the min, max, median and mean of file sizes
       for each file type the distribution of file sizes. Clicking on the file type will
       take you a new view displaying the signatures. Clicking on the mean will show a pop-up
       displaying the results of K-Means clustering.</p>
