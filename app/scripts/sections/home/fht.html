    <h4>File Header Trailer Analysis (FHT)</h4>

    <p>We've computed FHT matrices for all the file types in the data set. For each file type
       we computed the fht matrix by aggregating 75% of the files in each type. You can view
       fingerprints from multiple file types at a time. Each file type has a head/trail fingerprint.
       The size of the blob is indicative of the strength of the byte in the fingerprint.
       There is a character chart (just below) to correlate by readings with text characters.
       Alter the URL to this page to alter the FHT-OFFSET. (ie) /8, /16 or /32.</p>
