    <h4>Byte Frequency Correlation (BFC)</h4>

    <p>We've computed byte frequency correlation on all the file-types in the given polar dataset.
       We computed the average correlation between the signature for each type (75% data set) and
       a newly computed signature from the remaining data set. Values closer to 1 indicate high
       correlation. As you click on a particular type a table appears below indicating the top bytes
       which have the highest / lower correlation.</p>
